# PrepFlow AI

PrepFlow AI is an early-stage project focused on helping students turn ideas into
structured, portfolio-ready work.

This repository contains the deployed frontend and the foundation for future
backend development.

## Current State
- Static frontend deployed via GitHub Pages
- Public, verifiable project presence
- Backend under active development

## Planned Backend (Python)
The backend will be implemented in Python (FastAPI) and will support:
- Project planning and milestone generation
- Structured execution workflows
- AI-assisted guidance
- Exportable portfolio artifacts

The frontend and backend are intentionally decoupled to allow independent iteration.

## Status
In development.
