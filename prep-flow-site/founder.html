    <h2>About the Founder</h2>
    <p>
      PrepFlow AI was founded by <strong>Mansi Indarapu</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project began as a response to seeing strong student ideas stall due to
      lack of structure, planning, and execution systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      PrepFlow is being developed transparently alongside academic work and is
      intended to evolve as the underlying systems mature.
